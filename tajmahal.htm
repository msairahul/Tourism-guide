<p><h1><u>About TajMahal</u></h1>
<h2><i>Inspiration</i></h2>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>T</b>he Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian princess who died giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.Construction started in 1632,and the mausoleum was completed in 1643, while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later.The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the Taj Mahal.
<br>
<h2><i>Architecture and design</i></h2>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<b>T</b>he Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand), Humayun's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</p>
